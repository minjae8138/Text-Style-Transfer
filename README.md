# Styleformer
A Neural Language Style Transfer framework to transfer natural language text smoothly between fine-grained language styles like formal/casual, active/passive, and many more.For instance, understand [What makes text formal or casual/informal](https://www.niu.edu/writingtutorial/style/formal-and-informal-style.shtml).

## Usecases for Styleformer

**Area 1: Data Augmentation**
- Augment training datasets with various fine-grained language styles.

**Area 2: Post-processing**
- Apply style transfers to machine generated text. 
- e.g.
    - Refine a Summarised text to active voice + formal tone.
    - Refine a Translated text to more casual tone to reach younger audience.

**Area 3: Controlled paraphrasing**
- Formal <=> Casual transfers adds a notion of control over how we paraphrase when compared to free-form paraphrase where there is control or guarantee over the paraphrases.

**Area 4: Assisted writing**
- Integrate this to any human writing interfaces like email clients, messaging tools or social media post authoring tools. Your creativity is your limit to te uses. 
- e.g.
    - Polish an email with business tone for professional uses.

## Dataset
- The casual <=> formal dataset was generated using ideas mentioned in reference paper 1
- The positive <=> negative dataset was generated using ideas mentioned in reference paper 3
- Fined tuned on T5 on a Tesla T4 GPU and it took ~2 hours to train each of the above models with batch_size = 16 and epochs = 5.(Will share training args shortly)

## Benchmark
- TBD

## Streamlit Demo
```
pip install streamlit
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
